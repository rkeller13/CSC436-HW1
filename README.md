Homework 1


Submission Details:

	Github - https://github.com/rkeller13/CSC436-HW1
	
	I added comments above any section in the source file where I added code, they are prefaced with "RJK"
	
	The html sometimes has trouble with clearing certain containers after the various buttons are clicked numerous times
	But they also all work correctly at other times
	
	I spent approximately 6 hours on the homework, this is my first time doing anything with JavaScript
